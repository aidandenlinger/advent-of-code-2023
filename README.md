# aidandenlinger's Advent of Code 2023

Doing Advent of Code 2023 in Rust for practice and fun :)

Solutions prioritize legibility over optimality, although both are limited to
the extent of my knowledge ;). You can find Advent of Code 2023
[here](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

## Install
You need the rust toolchain, which you can install with
[rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

## Usage
Each day has two folders - one for part a and one for part b.

To run, create a folder called `input` at the top of the repo and place your
inputs inside, with the format `dayXX.txt`. Then, you can open that day and
part's folder and run `cargo run`. These solutions assume proper input, it will
panic on improper inputs.

`cargo test` will run basic tests on the examples from the problem prompt, as
well as test that it produces the expected answer from my input. If you change
the inputs, that unit test will now fail since the input is different, this
would be expected.

## Thanks
Thanks to other folks publishing their Rust repos so I can learn and improve
my code afterwards :)
